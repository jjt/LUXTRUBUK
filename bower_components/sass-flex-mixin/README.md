This is a set of mixins for those who want to mess
around with flexbox using the native support of current
browsers. For full support table check: http://caniuse.com/flexbox

Basically this will use:
- Fallback, old syntax (IE10, Safari, mobile webkit browsers)
- Prefixed standard syntax (Chrome)
- Final standards syntax (FF, IE11, Opera 12.1)
